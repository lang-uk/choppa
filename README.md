Partial python port of java SRX segmenter, [originally written](https://github.com/loomchild/segment) by Jarek Lipski aka `loomchild`.

In a nutshell it allows you to tokenize texts into the sentences (but generally it's rule-based, so you can chop anything textual).

Shipped with `segment.srx` set of segmentation rules for different languages, crafted by the great team of [languagetool](https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool).
